# Machine Learning

###### Learning is a key element of natural intelligence as well as artificial intelligence.

#### The types of machine learning

"Art of **extracting knowledge from data**"

> 1. **Supervised learning**: Task is to predict the correct output or label when given an input. For instance, which traffic sign is in the picture (speed limit, syop sign, etc.). The task of the machine learning algorithm is to find a model that predicts the correct answers (which are available) based on the input data.
> 2. **Unsupervised learning**: Task is to discover the structure of the data. Data visualization can also be considered unsupervised learning.  
> 3. **Reinforcement learning**
